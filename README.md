# GroupUs

### About
Group Us is an Android Application for putting a list of people into groups. Don't we all find ourselves in a situation where we want to play a game but waste alot of time picking groups, GroupUs should solve that problem, insert the list of names and the number of people expected in a group, and GroupUs will randomly pick the groups for you!

### How to build
